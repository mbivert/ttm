\begin{exercise} How long does it take for the oscillating
particle to go through one full cycle of motion?
\end{exercise}
We're in the case of a particle oscillating in one dimension.
Its motion, known as the \textit{simple harmonic motion},
is described by:
\[
	x(t) = \sin(\omega t)
\]
Essentially, $x(t)$ will correspond to the vertical component of
a point moving on the unit circle, located by an angle $\omega t$.

			\t = 30;
			\px = \r * cos(\t);
			\py = \r * sin(\t);

To fix things, consider the case of a particle starting at an
extreme position, say $x=1$ (at the top of the north hemisphere of
the unit circle). It will need to go down to $x=-1$, and then back
up to $x=1$. In the mean time, the corresponding point on the unit
circle would have walked a full circle, or $2\pi$ radians. \\

So we're looking for the time $T$ that it will take for us
to move by an angle $2\pi$, knowing that we move at a speed
of $\omega$ radians per unit of time (i.e. $\omega_{t=0}=0$,
$\omega_{t=1}=\omega$, $\omega_{t=2}=2\omega$, ...):
\[
	\omega T = 2\pi \Leftrightarrow \boxed{T = \frac{2\pi}\omega}
\]

\begin{remark}$T$ is commonly called the \textit{period} of motion.
