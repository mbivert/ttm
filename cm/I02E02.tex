\begin{exercise} Use the fundamental theorem of calculus to
evaluate each integral from Exercise $1$ with limits of
integration being $t=0$ to $t=T$.
\end{exercise}
We're going to build on the indefinite integrals we've just computed in
\href{https://github.com/mbivert/ttm/blob/master/cm/I02E01.pdf}{I02E01},
and simply evaluate the difference of the primitives between $t=T$ and $t=0$.
\begin{remark} There are two common notations to evaluate a primitive between
two values;Â I'll use the second one, out of habit. Let's recall the fundamental
theorem of calculus along the way:
\[
	\boxed{\left.F(t)\right|_a^b = \left[F(t)\right]_a^b \triangleq \int_a^bF'(t)\,dt = F(b)-F(a)}
\]
\end{remark}
\hr
$\bm{f(t) = t^4}$\ \\
The primitive was:
\[ \frac15t^5 + c,\quad c\in\mathbb{R} \]
Evaluated as expected gives:
\[
	\left[\frac15t^5 + c\right]_0^T = \frac15T^5+c-(\frac150^5+c)=\boxed{\frac15T^5}
\]
\begin{remark} Note how the constant of integration gets canceled. This will
happen systematically here.
\end{remark}
\hr
$\bm{f(t) = \cos t}$\ \\
The primitive was:
\[ \sin t + c,\quad c\in\mathbb{R} \]
Evaluated as expected gives:
\[
	\left[\sin t + c\right]_0^T = \sin T - \underbrace{\sin 0}_{=0} = \boxed{\sin T}
\]

\hr
$\bm{f(t) = t^2 - 2}$\ \\
The primitive was:
\[ \frac13t^3-2t+c,\quad c\in\mathbb{R} \]
Evaluated as expected gives:
\[
	\left[\frac13t^3-2t+c\right]_0^T = \boxed{\frac13T^3-2T}
\]
