Integrate this equation. \textit{Hint}: Use \textit{definite
integrals}.
\end{exercise}
The equation in question resulting from Newton's second law in
the case of a constant force $F_z$ being applied to an object
of mass $m$ following the $z$-axis:
\[
	\dot{v_z} = \dot{v_z(t)} = \frac{F_z}{m}
\]
By integrating both sides, thanks to the
\href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fundamental\_theorem_of\_calculus}
{fundamental theorem of calculus}, assuming the mass is constant over
time, we obtain:
\begin{align*}
	v_z(t) &= \int \frac{F_z}{m}\,dt \\
	~ &= \frac{F_z}{m}\int\,dt \\
	~ &= \frac{F_z}{m}t + c,\,c\in\mathbb{R}
\end{align*}
Generally, $c$ would be determine from an initial condition $v_z(0)$,
which is our case, would precisely be $c$, hence:
\[
	\boxed{v_z(t) = v_z(0) + \frac{F_z}{m}t}\qed
\]
Which is exactly the solution proposed in the book.
