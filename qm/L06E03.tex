\begin{exercise} Prove that the state $\ket{\text{sing}}$ cannot
be written as a product state.
\end{exercise}
Let's recall the definition of the so-called \textit{singlet} state
$\ket{\text{sing}}$:
\[
	\ket{\text{sing}} = \frac1{\sqrt2}\left(\ket{ud}-\ket{du}\right)
\]
As for the previous exercise, we're still in the context of combining
two state spaces: Alice's and Bob's, each representing the states of a
spin, where the general form of Alice's state vectors is:
\[
	\alpha_u\keit{u} + \alpha_d\keit{d},\quad (\alpha_u, \alpha_d)\in\mathbb{C}^2
\]
While spin states for the second space (Bob's) are denoted:
\[
	\beta_u\ket{u} + \beta_d\ket{d},\quad (\beta_u, \beta_d)\in\mathbb{C}^2
\]
In this context, let's clarify the difference between a product state and a
general composite state, with potential entanglement:
\begin{description}
	\item[Product state] obtained by developing a product between
	two states from Alice and Bob's state spaces, which yield something
	along the form:
	\[
		\alpha_u\beta_u\ket{uu}+\alpha_u\beta_d\ket{ud}
			+\alpha_d\beta_u\ket{du}+\alpha_d\beta_d\ket{dd}
	\]
	Remember from the previous exercise that such a state vector
	is naturally normalized, as a consequence of the normalization
	of the underlying vectors from Alice and Bob's space states;
	\item[General state for a $2$-spins system] obtained by linear
	combination of the vectors from the ordered basis
	$\{\ket{uu}, \ket{ud}, \ket{du}, \ket{dd}\}$:
	\[
		\Psi = \psi_{uu}\ket{uu} + \psi_{ud}\ket{ud}
			+ \psi_{du}\ket{du} + \psi_{dd}\ket{dd}
	\]
	And impose a normalization condition on the scalar factors:
	\[
		|\Psi| = 1 \Leftrightarrow \psi_{uu}^*\psi_{uu}
			+ \psi_{ud}^*\psi_{ud} + \psi_{du}^*\psi_{du}
			+ \psi_{dd}^*\psi_{dd} = 1
	\]
\end{description}
Clearly, $\ket{\text{sing}}$ is normalized: it's at least a
general state for a 2-spins system. Assume it is a product state.
Then there exists $(\alpha_u, \alpha_d, \beta_u, \beta_d)\in\mathbb{C}^4$
such that:
\[
	\begin{cases}
		\alpha_u\beta_d =& \dfrac1{\sqrt2} \\
		\alpha_d\beta_u =& \dfrac1{\sqrt2} \\
		\alpha_u\beta_u =& 0 \\
		\alpha_d\beta_d =& 0 \\
	\end{cases}
\]
But now, if $\alpha_u\beta_u = 0$, then at least either $\alpha_u = 0$ or
$\beta_u$ = 0. Assume $\alpha_u = 0$. But then, we can't have $\alpha_u\beta_d = 1/\sqrt2$.
Assume then $\beta_u = 0$. Yet in this case, we can't have $\alpha_d\beta_u = 1/\sqrt2$. \\

So the system isn't solvable and our previous assumption can't hold. Hence,
there's no such $(\alpha_u, \alpha_d, \beta_u, \beta_d)\in\mathbb{C}^4$, and
$\ket{\text{sing}}$ is not a product state. $\qed$
