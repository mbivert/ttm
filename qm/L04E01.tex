\begin{exercise} Prove that if $U$ is unitary, and if $\ket{A}$
and $\ket{B}$ are any two state-vectors, then the inner product
of $U\ket{A}$ and $U\ket{B}$ is the same as the inner product of
$\ket{A}$ and $\ket{B}$. One could call this the \textit{conservation
of overlaps}. It expresses the fact that the logical relation between
states is preserved with time.
\end{exercise}
The inner-product has been defined as the product of a bra and a ket.
So the inner-product of $U\ket{A}$ and $U\ket{B}$ is the product of e.g.
the bra associated to $U\ket{A}$ and $U\ket{B}$. But in section $3.1.5$
of the book, we've established that:
\[
	\ket{C} = M\ket{D} \Leftrightarrow \bra{C} = \bra{D}M^\dagger
\]

Hence the inner-product we're looking for is:
\[
	\bra{A}\underbrace{U^\dagger U}_{I}\ket{B} = \braket{A}{B} \qed
\]

\begin{remark} The terminology is a bit confusing: we're talking
about the inner-product of two kets, while we've \textit{defined}
the inner-product to be an operation between a bra and a ket. Overall,
the bra-ket notation makes things a little more complicated than just
having to deal with an inner-product space.
\end{remark}
