\begin{exercise} Use Eq. $7.22$ to show that if $\rho$ is a density
matrix, then
\[
	\Tr(\rho) = 1.
\]
\end{exercise}
Eq. $7.22$ is the following:
\[
	P(a) = \rho_{aa}
\]
Where $P(a)$ is the probability for an observable $L$ tied to
Alice's state space, extended to act on a composite state-space
made from Alice's and Bob's, to be measured with the eigenvalue $a$.
On the other hand, $\rho_{aa}$ corresponds to the diagonal elements
of Alice's density matrix, expressed in Alice state space. \\

Well, there will be one $P(a)$ for each eigenvalue, and thus by
Eq. $7.22$, there is a systematic correspondence with the diagonal
elements of the density matrix. But the trace of an operator is
defined as the sum of the diagonal elements of a matrix representation
of this operator, and it so happens that this value is unique up
to a change of basis (meaning, the trace of an operator is the same
for all matrix representation of this operator). \\

Hence because the eigenvalues $a$ represent all the potential measurement
values, we know that $\sum_aP(a) = 1$, which by our previous reasoning
implies indeed that $\boxed{\Tr(\rho) := \sum_a\rho_{aa}= \sum_aP(a) = 1} \qed$
