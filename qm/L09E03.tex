\begin{exercise} Show that the right-hand side of Eq. $9.17$ simplifies
to the right-hand side of Eq. $9.16$. \textit{Hint}: First expand the
second term by taking the derivative of the product. Then look for
cancellations.
\end{exercise}
Eq. $9.17$ and Eq. $9.16$ are respectively:
\[
	[\bm{V}(x), \bm{P}]\psi(x)
		= V(x)(-i\hbar\frac{d}{dx})\psi(x) - (-i\hbar\frac{d}{dx})V(x)\psi(x)
\]
\[
	[\bm{V}(x), \bm{P}] = i\hbar\frac{dV(x)}{dx}
\]

Let's start as suggested by expanding the second term of Eq. $9.17$,
ignoring the $-i\hbar$ factor for now: this is a basic product
rule application:
\[
	(\frac{d}{dx})(V(x)\psi(x)) =
		\frac{dV(x)}{dx}\psi(x) + V(x)\frac{d\psi(x)}{dx}
\]
The second term will cancel with the first term of the RHS of Eq. $9.17$:
\begin{equation*}\begin{aligned}
	[\bm{V}(x), \bm{P}]\psi(x) &=&&
		V(x)(-i\hbar\frac{d}{dx})\psi(x)
			- (-i\hbar\frac{d}{dx})V(x)\psi(x)	\\
		&=&& -i\hbar V(x)\frac{d\psi(x)}{dx} + i\hbar
			\left(
				\frac{dV(x)}{dx}\psi(x) + V(x)\frac{d\psi(x)}{dx}
			\right) \\
		~ &=&& i\hbar\frac{dV(x)}{dx}\psi(x)
\end{aligned}\end{equation*}
As long as $\psi(x)\neq0$, we can divide by $\psi(x)$, and indeed establish
Eq. $9.16$:
\[
	\boxed{[\bm{V}(x), \bm{P}] = i\hbar\frac{dV(x)}{dx}} \qed
\]
